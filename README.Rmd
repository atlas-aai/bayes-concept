This repository contains the source code for the Technical Report, *Bayesian psychometrics diagnostic assessments: A proof of concept*. The report is powered by [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org), which makes it easy to turn R markdown files into PDF.

The report can be found [here](https://dynamiclearningmaps.org/sites/default/files/documents/publication/Bayes_Proof_Concept_2019.pdf).

This report was built with:

```{r}
devtools::session_info(c("ratlas", "knitr", "english", "kableExtra", "tidyverse",
                         "rstan", "loo", "tidybayes",
                         "here", "glue", "fs"))
